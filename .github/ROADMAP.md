## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Realtime bugs | High | Medium | Extensive testing, fallback to polling |
| AI parsing fails | Medium | Medium | Always allow manual entry |
| RLS bypass | Critical | Low | Thorough security audits |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Optimize queries, add indexes |
| Mobile UX problems | High | Medium | Test on real devices early |

---

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **Supabase** - Backend (Auth, DB, Storage, Realtime)
- **Anthropic API** - Receipt parsing
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting

### Critical Path
1. Database must be complete before UI work
2. Auth must work before testing other features
3. Core features before real-time
4. Testing before deployment

---

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Current design supports up to 100 trips, 1000 users
- Database indexes ensure good query performance
- Realtime channels may need optimization at scale

### Monetization (Future)
- Free for personal use (MVP/V1.0)
- Potential premium features in V2.0+
  - Advanced analytics
  - Custom branding
  - White-label for travel agencies

### Maintenance
- Estimated 2-4 hours/month for updates and bug fixes
- Supabase handles infrastructure
- Minimal operational overhead
